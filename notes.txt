p. 63 Recursive process vs. procedure

"In contrasting iteration and recursion, we must be careful not to confuse the notion of a recursive _process_ with the notion of a recursive _procedure_.

When we describe a procedure as recursive, we are referring to the syntactic fact that the procedure definition refers to the procedure itself.

But when we describe a process as following a pattern that is, say, linearly recursive, we are speaking about how the process evolves, not about the syntax of how a procedure is written."

p. 231 Data-directed programming

"Whenever we deal with a set of generic operations that are common to a set of different types, we are dealing with a two-dimensional table that contains the possible operations on one axis and the possible types on the other axis."
