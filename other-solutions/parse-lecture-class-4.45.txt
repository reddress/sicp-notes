Exercise 4.45

With the grammar given above, the following sentence can be parsed in five different ways:

"The professor lectures to the student in the class with the cat."

Give the five parses and explain the differences in shades of meaning among them.

Solution:

The cat has three possibilities: with the professor, the student, or the class. Either the professor or the student is in the class. So there are 6 possibilities. However, if the cat is with the student, the word "class" must belong to the student because it is between the words "student" and "cat". Thus there are 5 ways to parse the sentence.

(3 choices for where the cat is: class, student, or professor)
(2 choices for who is in the class: student or professor)

professor in class
cat student

    1) With the cat, the professor lectures in the class. This means

        The cat is with the professor.
        The professor is in the class.

    2) The professor lectures in the class that has the cat. This means

        The cat is with the class.
        The professor is in the class.

    3) With the cat, the professor lectures to student who is in the class. This means

        The cat is with the professor.
        The student is in the class.

    4) The professor lectures to the student in the class who has the cat. This means

        The cat is with the student.
        The student is in the class.

    5) The professor lectures to student who is in the class that has the cat. This means

        The cat is with the class.
        The student is in the class.
